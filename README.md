# TETRIS
TETRIS in JAVA

**In order to run TETRIS you need to have JRE installed.**

This is a simple remake of TETRIS in JAVA. Score is based on NES version, but game area is 10x24 squares big. You can enable or disable HOLD function in settings.txt in program data folder of the program (program directory/data/settings.txt) by changing the first line either to T to enable or to F to disable hold. To control the pieces use arrow keys, ENTER or ESC to PAUSE the game and C to hold current piece. It also includes Discord Rich Presence API, so your discord friends can see that you're playing tetris.
